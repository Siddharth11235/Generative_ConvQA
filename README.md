# Generative_ConvQA

This is a paper I wrote for the course on Language Engineering and Applications course at KU Leuven. It represents
my view on how deep generative modelling can be an effective tool to obtain richer conversational semantics and
includes a couple of potential algorithms for doing so in a conversational question answering setting.
